<!-- ABOUT THE Program -->

##  About The Program

This is a maze solver program which is implemented using the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Btree data structure for improving the efficiency.
The Btree was implemented with a little help from [HERE](https://uxmankabir.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/cpp-program-to-perform-insertion-deletion-and-traversal-in-b-tree/).

###  Built With

* [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)



###  How to Use

#### Input:

 1. Number of rows and columns of your maze
 2. Your maze such that:
			
	‚õî:  0 means a dead end.
			
	‚õèÔ∏è: Positive numbers indicate the difficulty of that path.

#### Output:

The solved maze such that the shortest path from the start to the finish is marked with -1s.

  
####  Test Cases

  You can directly copy and paste the following test cases to try out the program. 

 1. First test case:
 
	    4 4

		0 1 1 1
		1 2 3 2
		0 0 1 0
		
2. Second test case:
		
		8 10
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
